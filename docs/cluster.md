# Set Up Clusters

This guide explains how to run NeMo RL with Ray on Slurm or Kubernetes.

## Use Slurm for Batched and Interactive Jobs

 The following code provides instructions on how to use Slurm to run batched job submissions and run jobs interactively.

### Batched Job Submission

```sh
# Run from the root of NeMo RL repo
NUM_ACTOR_NODES=1  # Total nodes requested (head is colocated on ray-worker-0)

COMMAND="uv run ./examples/run_grpo_math.py" \
CONTAINER=YOUR_CONTAINER \
MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD" \
sbatch \
    --nodes=${NUM_ACTOR_NODES} \
    --account=YOUR_ACCOUNT \
    --job-name=YOUR_JOBNAME \
    --partition=YOUR_PARTITION \
    --time=1:0:0 \
    --gres=gpu:8 \
    ray.sub
```

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your Slurm cluster configuration, you may or may not need to include the `--gres=gpu:8` option in the `sbatch` command.

Upon successful submission, Slurm will print the `SLURM_JOB_ID`:
```text
Submitted batch job 1980204
```
Make a note of the job submission number. Once the job begins, you can track its process in the driver logs which you can `tail`:
```sh
tail -f 1980204-logs/ray-driver.log
```

### Interactive Launching

> [!TIP]
> A key advantage of running interactively on the head node is the ability to execute multiple multi-node jobs without needing to requeue in the Slurm job queue. This means that during debugging sessions, you can avoid submitting a new `sbatch` command each time. Instead, you can debug and re-submit your NeMo RL job directly from the interactive session.

To run interactively, launch the same command as [Batched Job Submission](#batched-job-submission), but omit the `COMMAND` line:
```sh
# Run from the root of NeMo RL repo
NUM_ACTOR_NODES=1  # Total nodes requested (head is colocated on ray-worker-0)

CONTAINER=YOUR_CONTAINER \
MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD" \
sbatch \
    --nodes=${NUM_ACTOR_NODES} \
    --account=YOUR_ACCOUNT \
    --job-name=YOUR_JOBNAME \
    --partition=YOUR_PARTITION \
    --time=1:0:0 \
    --gres=gpu:8 \
    ray.sub
```
Upon successful submission, Slurm will print the `SLURM_JOB_ID`:
```text
Submitted batch job 1980204
```
Once the Ray cluster is up, a script will be created to attach to the Ray head node. Run this script to launch experiments:
```sh
bash 1980204-attach.sh
```
Now that you are on the head node, you can launch the command as follows:
```sh
uv run ./examples/run_grpo_math.py
```

### Slurm Environment Variables

All Slurm environment variables described below can be added to the `sbatch`
invocation of `ray.sub`. For example, `GPUS_PER_NODE=8` can be specified as follows:

```sh
GPUS_PER_NODE=8 \
... \
sbatch ray.sub \
   ...
```
#### Common Environment Configuration
``````{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Environment Variable
  - Explanation
* - `CONTAINER`
  - (Required) Specifies the container image to be used for the Ray cluster.
    Use either a docker image from a registry or a squashfs (if using enroot/pyxis).
* - `MOUNTS`
  - (Required) Defines paths to mount into the container. Examples:
    ```md
    * `MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD"` (mount in current working directory (CWD))
    * `MOUNTS="$PWD:$PWD,/nfs:/nfs:ro"` (mounts the current working directory and `/nfs`, with `/nfs` mounted as read-only)
    ```
* - `COMMAND`
  - Command to execute after the Ray cluster starts. If empty, the cluster idles and enters interactive mode (see the [Slurm interactive instructions](#interactive-launching)).
* - `HF_HOME`
  - Sets the cache directory for huggingface-hub assets (e.g., models/tokenizers).
* - `WANDB_API_KEY`
  - Setting this allows you to use the wandb logger without having to run `wandb login`.
* - `HF_TOKEN`
  - Setting the token used by huggingface-hub. Avoids having to run the `huggingface-cli login`
* - `HF_DATASETS_CACHE`
  - Sets the cache dir for downloaded Huggingface datasets.
``````

> [!TIP]
> When `HF_TOKEN`, `WANDB_API_KEY`, `HF_HOME`, and `HF_DATASETS_CACHE` are set in your shell environment using `export`, they are automatically passed to `ray.sub`. For instance, if you set:
>
> ```sh
> export HF_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
> ```
> this token will be available to your NeMo RL run. Consider adding these exports to your shell configuration file, such as `~/.bashrc`.

#### Advanced Environment Configuration
``````{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Environment Variable
    (and default)
  - Explanation
* - `UV_CACHE_DIR_OVERRIDE`
  - By default, this variable does not need to be set. If unset, `ray.sub` uses the 
    `UV_CACHE_DIR` defined within the container (defaulting to `/root/.cache/uv`). 
    `ray.sub` intentionally avoids using the `UV_CACHE_DIR` from the user's host 
    environment to prevent the host's cache from interfering with the container's cache. 
    Set `UV_CACHE_DIR_OVERRIDE` if you have a customized `uv` environment (e.g., 
    with pre-downloaded packages or specific configurations) that you want to persist 
    and reuse across container runs. This variable should point to a path on a shared 
    filesystem accessible by all nodes (head and workers). This path will be mounted 
    into the container and will override the container's default `UV_CACHE_DIR`.
* - `CPUS_PER_WORKER=128`
  - CPUs each Ray worker node claims. Default is `16 * GPUS_PER_NODE`.
* - `GPUS_PER_NODE=8`
  - Number of GPUs each Ray worker node claims. To determine this, run `nvidia-smi` on a worker node.
* - `BASE_LOG_DIR=$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`
  - Base directory for storing Ray logs. Defaults to the Slurm submission directory ([SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#OPT_SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR)).
* - `NODE_MANAGER_PORT=53001`
  - Port for the Ray node manager on worker nodes.
* - `OBJECT_MANAGER_PORT=53003`
  - Port for the Ray object manager on worker nodes.
* - `RUNTIME_ENV_AGENT_PORT=53005`
  - Port for the Ray runtime environment agent on worker nodes.
* - `DASHBOARD_AGENT_GRPC_PORT=53007`
  - gRPC port for the Ray dashboard agent on worker nodes.
* - `METRICS_EXPORT_PORT=53009`
  - Port for exporting metrics from worker nodes.
* - `PORT=6379`
  - Main port for the Ray head node.
* - `RAY_CLIENT_SERVER_PORT=10001`
  - Port for the Ray client server on the head node.
* - `DASHBOARD_GRPC_PORT=52367`
  - gRPC port for the Ray dashboard on the head node.
* - `DASHBOARD_PORT=8265`
  - Port for the Ray dashboard UI on the head node. This is also the port
    used by the Ray distributed debugger.
* - `DASHBOARD_AGENT_LISTEN_PORT=52365`
  - Listening port for the dashboard agent on the head node.
* - `MIN_WORKER_PORT=54001`
  - Minimum port in the range for Ray worker processes.
* - `MAX_WORKER_PORT=54257`
  - Maximum port in the range for Ray worker processes.

> [!NOTE]
> For the most part, you will not need to change ports unless these
> are already taken by some other service backgrounded on your cluster.
